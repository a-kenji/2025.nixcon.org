## Encounter everyone at NixCon with as little bias as possible.

## Take responsibility for your own wellbeing and look after yourself and your needs.

You can leave a conversation, an event or the premises at any time or respectfully remind others that your boundaries have been violated. Several rooms are available to serve as safe spaces â€“ just speak to the orga.

## Act considerately and respectfully towards others, their needs and boundaries.

For example, make sure you respect other people's personal space, speak clearly and use the correct way of addressing people (pronouns). Be aware of how long you speak when making contributions to discussions, listen attentively and refrain from interrupting others.
Only take pictures of people *after* obtaining their consent. This means: Don't take pictures of the crowd or run around vlog style.

## Use gender neutral ways of addressing people and only use pronouns when you know which pronouns (if any) they prefer.

People may not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. Just because you perceive someone as male or female, this person will not necessarily identify the same way. Please introduce yourself with your pronoun and ask how others want to be addressed. Some people prefer not to use any pronouns or to use all pronouns, or they just want to be addressed by their name. Please respect this also when talking about others in their absence. Show solidarity and tell others when they misgender people.

## If you are unsure, ask if your behaviour is acceptable to others and what they are comfortable with.

Ask, for example, if it is alright to speak to someone or how they would like to be addressed. For example, ask if someone would like to have company at lunch or if they would prefer to be alone. Boundaries, boundary violations and discrimination are defined by those who experience them

## Try to stay open and curious in conflicts or differences of opinion and be ready to expand your comfort zone and to question your own point of view. Speak and listen with an open heart.

## If someone asks for your support or if you notice something going on, offer support.

If you notice that someone feels uncomfortable or if you observe that someone withdraws from contact, feel free to approach them. Ask them directly how they are and if they need anything. But also accept their response if they prefer to be left alone. If you witness a conflict or discrimination, offer the person affected by it your support or alert the awareness team. Offer your help in situations where someone needs it (e.g. if they need assistance with the location, if they are physically unwell, if they experience limited mobility, if the lift is out of order), but don't impose on them.

## You are not alone. Ask for help or advice when you don't know what to do.

Apologize when you make mistakes and be open to criticism and feedback. We all make mistakes. Instead of becoming defensive, listen and appreciate the fact that someone is drawing your attention to your problematic behaviour so that you can learn from it.

## Respect the event venue.

Follow the venue's rules, leave the rooms and the furniture clean and tidy after you use them. Provide pro-active feedback and practise open and mindful communication with others.

If you need help at the event, you can reach out to any NixCon staff member, recognizable by the pink NixCon 2024 t-shirts.

Privately reach out to the awareness team by pinging any admin in the Matrix channel @nixcon-awareness:matrix.org or via phone: [REDACTED].
